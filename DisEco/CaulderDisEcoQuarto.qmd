Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

![The image above is the epidemiological triad. The epidemiological triad is used to show the 3 main factors that influence disease spread and control. The 3 factors demonstrated in the figure above are host, environment, and pathogen. However, host-pathogen systems are more complex than this triangle represents. There can be multiple hosts, multiple pathogens, or a differing environment which all will impact the spread and control of disease, ](images/clipboard-2246306219.png)
